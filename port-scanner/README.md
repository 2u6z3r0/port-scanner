I'm trying to build a port scanner which scans the well known the ports. After that it will detect the service and the version its running on. In future I'll add new feature to search for any know bugs present in the service we discovered by scanning the specific port.

I'm very new to this python world, just started learing so thought practically writing code while learning will be more effective.
